In a General purpose operating system Frames may be dropped to provide seamless multitasking and are not preferable for timing critical applications . 
Real time OS is more useful for timing critical applications and gives us considerable control on the tasks performed .
In case of a 32 bit microcontroller we have a relatively less number of jobs and interfaces as compared to a microprocessor therefore RTOS is preferred and for microprocessors there are multiple interfacing with memories and other tasks which requires a more complex operating system therefore General purpose OS is used
